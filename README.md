# FoodClassification

## About

Utilizing convolutional neural networks to classify images of food. 

Convolutional neural networks give us the ability to easily scale to thousands of different classes, as seen in the well-known ImageNet dataset of 1000 classes, used to benchmark computer vision algorithm performance.

Here we will be utilizing the Food-101 dataset with 101,000 images of food within 101 classes to build an image classifier using the high-level API Keras running on top of tensorflow.
